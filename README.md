# User Story
```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight,sets,reps, and duration of exercise.

If the exercise is a cardio exercise, 
I should be able to track my distance traveled.
